# Portable CLOS
A portable CLOS/MOP package for new CL implementations

## Project Goals
- Help new CL implementations quickly getting CLOS from ANSI-compliant Closette or directly PCL.
- Help exist CL implementations (those still use Closette, i.e. ABCL, Corman) easier upgrading to PCL.
- Synchronize PCL patches between different CL implementations (i.e. CMUCL, SBCL).
- Incorporate new MOP features into PCL, from other non-Closette non-PCL implementations (i.e. Clozure CL, CLISP).
- Minimize the support efforts for "Closer to MOP" project when this project is used by any CL implementation.

## What did we begin with
- The original Closette 1.0 from the AMOP book
- Latest Xerox PCL, version "September 16 92 PCL (f)"

## What do we have now
- Nothing as Jun 3, 2015
